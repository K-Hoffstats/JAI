#### Juvenile shad electrofishing survey ####
#### last modified: 10232025

# The purpose here is to recreate some of the traditional "looked at" graphics
# and/or analyses for the juvenile shad report, for DFP-25. Intent is to make
# things match the presentation quality of my other sections, now that no one
# else is around to do this work...

# In the past, they've presented as follows: 

# Table 1. total sample trips, time, ams caught, and CPUE (#/min) separated out
# for all the Santee + Congaree sites (A-G)--pretty straightforward here; this
# should be an easy and informative thing to retain. "What sites produce...?"

# Figure 3. bar chart of number of the "top 10" species caught--perhaps just 
# make this a table instead; better visualization to easily compare years.

# Figure 4.annual catch rates, plotted through the season (vs.DOY), with water
# temp as the secondary y-axis

# Figure 5. bar chart of # ams caught per year, fit with a line to represent total
# effort (seconds)

# Figure 6.stacked years, ams catch by month--this was actually adult ams, but if
# we want to move forward with this (see monthly presence of the species) we should
# just adapt this to my stacked graphic paradigm.
